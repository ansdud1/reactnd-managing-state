### Instructions

You're given a starter template with dummy data.

**Task**: Create a game that shows an equation of the form X+Y+Z=P. Here,
X, Y, and Z should be random numbers, and P should be the proposed answer. The
user should be able tcorrect
answers]/[number of questions answered]. Every time the user answers a question,
a new question that uses randomly generated numbers is displayed.

Remember that a Component's constructor is the first thing that runs when the
object is created. The render method gets called automatically every time the state changes
inside of the component and anytime the value of the component's props changes.

This exercise will help you practice what you've learned in the course so far, including the trickiest part of React - managing state.
